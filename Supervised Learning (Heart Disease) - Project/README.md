# üè• Advanced Predictive Modeling for Heart Disease Using Machine Learning  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model capable of predicting the presence of heart disease based on clinical attributes. Using structured data, classification techniques, and supervised learning, we aim to assist doctors in making data-driven decisions for early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.  

## üí° Problem Statement  
A major hospital is interested in investing in machine learning to enhance diagnostic accuracy. They have provided a heart disease dataset and want us to determine whether machine learning can effectively predict heart disease based on patient attributes.  

**Goal:** Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?  

## üìä Dataset Information  
We utilize the **Heart Disease Dataset** from Kaggle:
